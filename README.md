differ - comparator/reporter of filesystem changes
==================================================

This little tool will recursivelly comparey two directory trees and report changes in their structure. 
It also detects modified files and provides a nice overview of the changes in a side-by-side view.

It's main purpose is to generate html reports of modifications in (diff friendly) 
documents that may be relevant when performing a new release (changes in gherkin/feature files, markdown documentation, etc).
